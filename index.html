									<h2>The idea of Common Endeavour</h2>
									<p>Political renewal</p>
								</header>
								<p>Common Endeavour is at heart about political renewal. It stems from the belief that political parties are important institutions in contemporary democracies but that our current, governing parties are failing to provide leadership in supporting democratic institutions, in policy development, and in good government. Common Endeavour explores the idea of an alternative party of government, working to revitalise democracy by reconnecting Australian communities with each other, with politics, and ultimately with their government.</p>
								<p>Inspired in the first instance by Simone Weil’s work <a href="https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/abolition-all-political-parties">On the Abolition of All Political Parties</a> and Ted Mack’s career as an elected representative at each level of government in Australia (summarised beautifully in his powerful <a href="https://parkesfoundation.org.au/activities/orations/2013-ted-mack/">2013 Parkes Oration</a>), the idea of Common Endeavour is to foster a renewed political purpose that will deliver a political party that people can be proud to vote for.</p>

										<h3>Connecting and Connection</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Connection is at the heart of Common Endeavour. Our connections with each other are a vital part of who we are. Recognising the importance of connection to our wellbeing, to our flourishing, allows us to build on the strengths of those connections, and meet the challenges and pitfalls that sometimes come with connection.</p>
									<p>Connection simulataneously recognises our individual autonomy and our interdependence and provides a powerful foundation on which to build a social organisation that fosters purposeful and productive self-governance.</p>
									<p><em>Nation Building</em>, and <em>the Common Good</em> are two concrete expressions of connection. They are important ideas for the work, and workings, of Common Endeavour.</p>
									<header>
										<h3>Connection in Practice</h3>
										<p>Nation Building</p>
									</header>

									<p>Political stagnation over the past 30 years has led to differences and divisions being amplified. This makes Nation Building &mdash; emphasising our common interests &mdash; fundamental to political renewal.</p>
									<p>Important nation building activities include: Strengthening engagement and respect for our First Nations peoples, Tax reform, Energy security, secure Housing, and tackling Intergenerational trauma.</p>
									<header>
										<p>the Common Good</p>
									</header>
									<p>the Common Good is what happens when we value and take seriously our relationships with each other.  The result can be a physical object (a memorial pool), a service (aged care), or an institution (our legal system).</p>
									 <p>the Common Good is defined at the community level; your town or neighbourhood, your state, your nation, or anything in between. Fostering the Common Good is central to the purpose of Common Endeavour.</p>
									<p>You can see what we’re writing about these ideas at the <a href="https://journal.commonendeavour.org">Common Endeavour journal</a>. Read more and sign up for new material there!</p>

										<h2>A Common Endeavour</h2>
										<p>Next Steps</p>
									</header>
									<p>Common Endeavour is just getting started — we’re keen to get going.</p>
									<p>What our politics needs — integrity, engagement, care, equity, competence &mdash; is well understood. Embedding these values in a new party of government is a big task; it will require our best efforts.</p>

									<p>To that end, we’re currently convening an advisory group to guide the development of Common Endeavour’s organisational foundations as a political party.</p>
									<p style="margin-left:10%"><font size="-1">(<em>If you’re interested in helping with this task let us know on one of the channels at the bottom of this page.</em>)</font></p>

									<p>To learn more about what’s important to Common Endeavour, check out our <a href="#ideas">Motivating Ideas</a> page or head over to the <a href="https://journal.commonendeavour.org">Common Endeavour journal</a> where we explore the ideas at the heart of Common Endeavour — <em>Connection</em>, <em>Nation Building</em>, and <em>the Common Good</em> — in more depth. While you’re there, you can also sign up for the Human Connection newsletter so you never miss a new post.</p>
									<p>You can also support Common Endeavour by joining the conversation at our socials channels below. Let’s start something incredible, something to be proud of, political renewal that will make a difference.</p>

										<p>Common Endeavour acknowledges that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the First Peoples of Australia.</p>
										<p>We recognise their continuing connection to land, waters and culture.</p>
										<p>We pay respect to Elders past and present.</p>
										<p>Common Endeavour was inspired by life in Kambuwal, Yuggera and Ugarapul Country. The Common Endeavour project is currently based on that Country and in Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country.</p>
										<p>We cherish the privilege of living in this extraordinary, beautiful land of mountains and plains; of forests and deserts; of waterways and lakes and seas; tended for so long with such care by Australia's First Nations people.</p>

            				  <h2>Why a New Party</h2>
            				<p>Observations and Provocations</p>
           					</header>
											<h3>Rationale</h3>
										<p>We need a new party of government because the ones we have now aren't as good as they should be and they're not getting better as quickly as we need them to.<br>
            				Independents and some of our minor parties are pushing politics in the right direction but our PoGs aren't taking the hint as avidly as we need them to.</p>
            					<h3>Motivation</h3>
            				<p>Political parties are an important institution in Australian democracy and parties of government play a special role within that institution. That role includes setting the political and social agenda; exercising leadership; and &mdash; when in government &mdash; of representing the whole country or state.<p>
            				<p>More on this soon at the <a href="https://blog.commonendeavour.org">Common Endeavour online journal</a>.</p>
