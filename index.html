									<h2>The idea of Common Endeavour</h2>
									<p>Political renewal<br>
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>Common Endeavour is an idea of a political party premised on the belief that we can do politics better; that our political culture needs to change; and that political parties have a role in that change.</p>
								<p>Inspired in the first instance by Simone Weil’s work <a href="https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/abolition-all-political-parties">On the Abolition of All Political Parties</a> and
									Ted Mack’s career as an elected representative at all three levels of government in Australia (summarised beautifully in his powerful <a href="https://parkesfoundation.org.au/activities/orations/2013-ted-mack/">2013 Parkes Oration</a>), the idea of Common Endeavour
									involves breaking from the obsession with winning elections at any cost, instead embracing a renewed political purpose dedicated to developing and delivering good public policy; sound public administration; and political integrity.</p>
								<p>If you would like to be part of building an organisation with this aspiration, please check out our <a href="#next">Next Steps</a> page, email us at <a href="mailto:z-axis@commonendeavour.org">Common Endeavour</span></a>,
									or contact us on one of the other channels at the bottom of our <a href="#">landing</a> page.</p>

										<h2>The ideas of Common Endeavour</h2>
						<!--				<p>Meaning and purpose<br />
										</p> -->
									</header>
									<header>
										<p>Connecting and Connection</p>
									</header>
									<p>Our connections with each other are a vital part of who we are. Recognising their importance, and the ways they can be good - or bad - for us, is at the heart of Common Endeavour.</p>
									<header>
										<p>Nation Building</p>
									</header>
									<p>Political stagnation over the past 30 years has led to a country where differences and divisions are amplified. This makes Nation Building fundamental to politcal renewal.</p>
									<p>Proposed Nation Building activities include: Tax reform, strengthening respect for our First Nations, and tackling intergenerational trauma.</p>
									<header>
										<p>the Common Good</p>
									</header>
									<p>the Common Good is what happens when we value and take seriously our relationships with each other.
										 What we get can be a physical object (a memorial pool), a service (aged care), or an institution (the legal system).</p>
									   <p>the Common Good (and the relationships involved) is defined at the community level, whether that is your town
										 or neighbourhood, your state, your nation, or anything in between.</p>

											<h2>Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Common Endeavour acknowledges that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the First Peoples of Australia.</p>
										<p>We recognise their continuing connection to land, waters and culture.</p>
										<p>We pay respect to Elders past and present.</p>
										<p>Common Endeavour was inspired by life in Yuggera and Ugarapul Country. The Common Endeavour project is currently based on that Country and in
												Ngunnawal and Ngambri Country.</p>
										<p>We cherish the privlege of living in this extraordinary, beautiful land of mountains and plains; of forests and deserts; of waterways and lakes and seas;
											 tended for so long with such care by Australia's First Nations people.</p>
